OK, so it seems like the DNS setup went OK. I can now browse my site at mikehansford.id.au.

I also now have another test site (just the starter site from creating a site from the Vite ReactJS template) configured as the subdomain (github.mikehansford.id.au). Looks like I've passed my first domain config...
