Static site generation needs work. When I create new content, it isn't being reflected on the site. I'll need to see how the `revalidate` property of `getStaticProps` actually works; whether a rebuild will be forced or not. If not, what are my options? 
1. Use Server side rendering instead
2. Implement a hook in Strapi so that once new content is posted, a rebuild of the front end is triggered on Netlify

I'm not sure there are other options right now: to be determined...
