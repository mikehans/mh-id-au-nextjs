So I _had_ a working DNS through my external provider. I want to see how it goes following the steps to have Netlify DNS take over my domain name. 

I've replaced the Name Server settings on my external provider. It looks like I need to wait a few days for the change to propagate through the internet before I can proceed. Nervous moments...
