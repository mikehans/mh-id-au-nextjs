Getting closer to releasing my site on NextJS with Strapi backend.

I have a fairly solid basis for development. I suspect there are a few hacks to create the API I need. There is likely to be a more Strapi-like way of doing it. The backend is on Strapi v3.x, which is out of date considering v.4.x is well and truly released. The upgrade path is unclear and I've prioritised getting an initial release. I also want to host images are to be hosted in Cloudinary, which is also TBD.

Staying up to date with product releases is important in order to avoid ending up several major versions behind and having a lengthy upgrade path.
