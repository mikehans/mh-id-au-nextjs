Switching to static site compilation with a Markdown content layer has been relatively easy. Managing my content in a git submodule is likely to cause its own headaches - especially around images - but at least content and site design are separate.

So far most basic functionality exists, even if there's a lot of refactoring required like inlined paths and duplicated components. Getting to "done-ish" is important so that I can focus on content and projects, rather than builing the site.
