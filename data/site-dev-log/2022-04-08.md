Controlling heading levels is an issue, especially when I'm re-using components. It's important to be aware of how headings are structured in a site as it has a direct bearing on accessibility. Perhaps more deliberate thought to information architecture would be the solution to my woes but I not yet convinced it's worth it, given the scope and purpose of this site.
