Heroku is dumping free plans, so that's the end of my Strapi CMS on Heroku. I was becoming concerned about increasing project complexity and this is really part of the impetus to simplify back to content being stored in Markdown. However, this time I want to separate the content from the site design - this mixing created a problem with my older Gatsby site where site design changes and content changes were in the same repo.
