title: Hi I'm Mike

... and welcome to my site.

I'm a software developer, husband and dad, woodworker, gardener and beer enthusiast. 

I maintain a tech blog here where I write about web development topics and also show the tech projects I have underway or have completed. If they are in a running state, you'll be able to check it out. They come and go - I don't have production constraints.
