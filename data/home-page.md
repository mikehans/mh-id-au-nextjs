title: Hi I'm Mike

... and welcome to my site.

I'm a software developer, family man, woodworker, gardener, beer enthusiast and electronics hack. 

On this site, I maintain a tech blog where I write about web development topics and also show the tech projects I have underway or have completed. If they are running, you'll be able to check it out. They come and go - I don't have production constraints.
