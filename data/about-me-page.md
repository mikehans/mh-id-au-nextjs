title: 'About Me'
---
I'm a software developer with extensive experience in web development, Microsoft Office and other unmentionables that I'd like to forget.

I blog about different aspects of web development such as React, C#, NodeJS and databases, though I touch on other topics of interest as well.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm something of a beer enthusiast, gardener and woodworker. I try to grow vegetables and periodically wonder what to do with a glut in some vegetable or another or to bemoan the failure of some other crop. This year, the tomatoes have been really poor.

This site is definitely a work in progress too. The process of owning and building a site is one that I generally wouldn't experience while working for others and it exposes me to new elements such as owning a domain, managing hosting and configuring TLS.
