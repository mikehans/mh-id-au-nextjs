title: 'About Me'
---
I'm a software developer with extensive experience in web development, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Office.

I blog about different aspects of web development such as React, C#, NodeJS and databases, though I'll likely touch on other topics of interest.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm something of a gardener, woodworker and electronics hack. I try to grow vegetables and periodically wonder what to do with a glut in some vegetable or another or to bemoan the failure of some other crop.

This site is definitely a work in progress too. The process of owning and building a site is one that I generally wouldn't experience while working for others and it exposes me to new elements such as owning a domain, managing hosting and configuring TLS.
