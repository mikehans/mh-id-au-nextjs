title: 'About Me'
---
I'm a software developer with extensive experience in web development, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Office.

I blog about different aspects of web development such as React, C#, NodeJS and databases, though I'll likely touch on other topics of interest.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm something of a gardener, woodworker and electronics hack. I try to grow vegetables and periodically wonder what to do with a glut in some vegetable or another or to bemoan the failure of some other crop.

This site is definitely a work in progress too. It's somewhat bare-bones right now. It's been rather a while since I designed a website from scratch, having worked predominantly on established websites. This site is being built (presently) in NextJS and hosted on Netlify with a Strapi headless CMS on Heroku. I have a lot to learn and it should be a lot of fun.
